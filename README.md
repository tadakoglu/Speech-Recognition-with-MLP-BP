# Speech-Recognition-with-MLP-BP
I have developed an simple speech recognition engine based on words using Multilayer Perceptrons with Hypebolic Tangent activation function and Backpropagation learning algorithm.




***
**Important**

Extract rastamat.rar library(rastamat as a folder) into the main directory of the application.
For example application might be able to reach melfcc.m file in rastamat folder as "rastamat/melfcc.m".
Then, start with demo.m in MATLAB.
